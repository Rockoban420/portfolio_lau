## Description

My portoflio Website!
I created this with a goal of making the best looking portfolio I could, I put a lot of work into it and learned a lot along the way.
It solves the problem of not having a personal website now whenever I want to refer somebody to be all they have to do is click on a link
I learned how to align multiple images on the same area and put text on them and it properly working, that took most of the time the rest was the header and flexbox troubleshooting.

## Usage

Just click on the link and take a look!
